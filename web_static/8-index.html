							That’s how I want you to feel – Like a king, or a queen for that matter.
							My hotelier decided his Urbandale hotel was not to be about pomp and circumstance, but about a commodity that’s become very precious these days – simplicity.

							And in my king room you can find it at it’s highest level of perfection: A comfortable king size bed covered with luxurious Villa di Lusso crisp white cotton linens and a large bathroom with spacious walk-in glass shower and Carrera marble vanity - Features I’m quite proud of, I must admit.

							To leave you feeling truly pampered, my people have also chosen some real special bath amenities for you
							- Beekman 1802.
							I’m telling you - getting up and going to bed has never been more pleasurable.

							And of course, I also offer today’s hotel room essentials: a modern desk workspace and a comfy oversized chair with ottoman. The designer also threw in state of the art technology including complimentary high-speed wired and wireless internet, and they added a fridge and a Starbucks™ coffee maker.

							Come on in – I’d be delighted to hosting you!
